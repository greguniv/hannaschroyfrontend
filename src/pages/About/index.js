                My name is Hanna and I am a freelance Cartoonist, Storyboard Artist, and Illustrator.

                I was born and raised in Texas until college where I attended the Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta, Georgia, graduating in 2017.  I am currently residing in Austin, TX, though who knows where the future may take me!

                I love to read and draw comics and I have a strong passion for video games.  Stories with romance, friendship and a little horror are my absolute favorites.

                Check out my upcoming convention schedule below or reach out to me through my contact page.
